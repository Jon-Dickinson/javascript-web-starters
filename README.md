# javascript-web-starters

It can be daunting to get started with a new Javascript web project, because there are so many technologies to use, and they all fit together in different ways. Each technology fills a particular niche.

This project contains various samples showing how to tie modern technologies together to build rich Javascript-powered websites.

The goals for each sample project:

- Minimum, but useful enough to be used as a "starter" template for new projects.
- Lots of code comments to explain technology choices.

# Technologies used

The samples are made up combinations of the following technologies:

- [ES-2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) - the latest version of Javascript at the time of writing.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Modern ES with static type checking.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Reads Javascript file dependencies (eg. imports) and builds bundles that contain all the necessary code.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Transpiles modern ES and CSS (and other things) to plain code that the browser understands.
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - "Sassy CSS", modern CSS with many useful features.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A Javascript library used to build user interfaces.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A predictable state management library.
